# ELIZAclone
This is a clone of MIT's ELIZA - one of the earliest iterations of a chatbot.

This implementation is guided by [John Crickett's Coding Challenge #89 - Eliza](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-89-eliza?r=gjveo&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true). You can also try the original Eliza [here](https://sites.google.com/view/elizaarchaeology/try-eliza).

This is mainly an exercise in conversational logic and regex building. It is one of the most primitive versions of modern natural language processing, which I wanted to try out to learn more about from the most basic building blocks.

To use this, you can run main.py from your IDE or console line with ```python main.py``` in the ELIZAclone directory with python version 3.0+.
